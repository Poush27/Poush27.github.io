# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Loan Application Dataset**

**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates my ability to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The analysis focuses on identifying trends, cleaning data, and uncovering insights from a loan application dataset. This project is part of my portfolio to showcase my data analysis skills.

**Features**

**Data Cleaning:**

Handled missing values by dropping columns with over 30% null values.
Processed dataset to improve quality and reliability.

**Data Insights:**

Explored patterns in loan application data.
Analyzed relationships between key variables.

**Visualizations:**

Created plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate trends and distributions.

**Description:**

The dataset includes detailed information about loan applications, with over 300,000 rows and 122 features. The target variable indicates loan repayment status (0 = Repaid, 1 = Not Repaid).

**Technologies Used**

* **Python:** Core programming language.

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation.

* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.

* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For visualizations.

* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive analysis.

**Usage**

* Use the notebook to understand EDA techniques for cleaning and analyzing large datasets.
* Visualize relationships between variables to gain actionable insights.
* Adapt the methods to analyze similar datasets.
